## 🎯 What You'll Learn

This comprehensive tutorial transforms you from someone who "vibes" with AI outputs to a practitioner who builds **data-driven evaluation systems that scale**. Whether you're an ML engineer shipping your first AI feature or a technical PM leading an AI product team, this tutorial provides the frameworks, tools, and real-world examples you need to evaluate AI systems with confidence.

### Learning Outcomes

By completing this tutorial, you will be able to:

- **Design evaluation systems** that catch failures before they reach users
- **Build automated evaluation pipelines** using LLM-as-a-Judge approaches you can actually trust
- **Conduct systematic error analysis** that reveals the highest-ROI improvements
- **Establish production monitoring** that alerts you to quality degradation in real-time
- **Optimize evaluation costs** while maintaining comprehensive coverage
- **Navigate the vendor landscape** with confidence and make informed tool choices

## 🎓 Who This Tutorial Is For

### Primary Audience
- **ML Engineers** building AI products who need to move beyond proof-of-concepts
