# Module 5: Architecture-Specific Evaluation Strategies

![Architecture Comparison Matrix](../../assets/diagrams/architecture-comparison-matrix.png)

## Overview

Architecture-specific evaluation represents the frontier of AI assessment, where generic evaluation approaches give way to specialized strategies tailored to the unique characteristics, capabilities, and failure modes of different AI system architectures. This module provides comprehensive frameworks for evaluating five critical AI architectures that dominate modern production systems: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Conversational AI/Chatbots, Multimodal AI Systems, Content Generation Platforms, and Autonomous AI Agents.

The complexity of modern AI systems demands evaluation approaches that understand and account for architecture-specific behaviors, failure patterns, and performance characteristics. A one-size-fits-all evaluation strategy fails to capture the nuanced requirements of different architectures, leading to inadequate quality assessment, missed failure modes, and suboptimal system performance. Organizations that master architecture-specific evaluation achieve 40-60% better system reliability, 35-50% faster time-to-production, and 25-40% higher user satisfaction compared to those using generic evaluation approaches.
