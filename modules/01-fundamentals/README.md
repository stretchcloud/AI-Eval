- **[Templates](templates/)** - Ready-to-use frameworks and assessment tools

## üîß Key Frameworks Introduced

### The Three Gulfs Model
A conceptual framework that categorizes the primary challenges in LLM development:
- **Gulf of Comprehension**: The gap between developers and their understanding of data
- **Gulf of Specification**: The gap between developers and LLM pipeline behavior  
- **Gulf of Generalization**: The gap between training data and real-world performance

### The Analyze-Measure-Improve (AMI) Lifecycle
A practical methodology for systematic LLM evaluation:
- **Analyze**: Qualitative understanding of system behavior and failure modes
- **Measure**: Quantitative assessment through systematic metrics and evaluation
- **Improve**: Targeted improvements based on empirical evidence

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Investment

**Total Module Time**: 4-6 hours
- Reading and comprehension: 2-3 hours
- Hands-on exercises: 1-2 hours  
- Case study analysis: 1 hour

## üéØ Target Audience

This module is designed for:
- **ML Engineers** new to systematic AI evaluation
- **Technical PMs** needing to understand evaluation fundamentals
- **Team Leaders** establishing evaluation practices
- **Anyone** transitioning from ad-hoc testing to systematic evaluation

## üìã Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts
- Familiarity with software development practices
- Experience with APIs and web services (helpful but not required)

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Start with the fundamentals**: Begin with [Why Evaluation Matters](01-why-evaluation-matters.md)
2. **Follow the sequence**: Each section builds on the previous one
3. **Complete exercises**: Hands-on practice reinforces concepts
4. **Apply to your context**: Use templates to adapt concepts to your specific use case

**Next**: [Module 2 - Systematic Error Analysis](../02-error-analysis/README.md)

## üí° Key Takeaways Preview

After completing this module, you'll understand that effective AI evaluation is not about finding the perfect metric, but about building systems that help you make better decisions faster. You'll have a framework for thinking about evaluation that scales from your first prototype to production systems serving millions of users.

The most successful AI teams don't just build great models‚Äîthey build great evaluation systems that enable rapid iteration and confident deployment. This module gives you the foundation to build those systems.
