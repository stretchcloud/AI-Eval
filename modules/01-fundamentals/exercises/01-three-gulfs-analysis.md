# Exercise 1: Three Gulfs Analysis

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By completing this exercise, you will:
- Apply the Three Gulfs Model to analyze a real LLM application scenario
- Identify specific gaps in comprehension, specification, and generalization
- Develop targeted strategies for bridging each gulf
- Create actionable improvement plans based on gulf analysis

## üìã Scenario: Customer Support Email Classifier

You're working on an LLM-powered customer support system that automatically classifies incoming emails into categories (billing, technical, general inquiry, complaint) and extracts key information (urgency level, customer ID, issue summary).

**Current Situation:**
- The system works well in testing but performs poorly in production
- Customer complaints about misclassified emails are increasing
- The development team is struggling to understand why performance degrades
- Different team members have conflicting theories about the root causes

## üîç Part 1: Gulf Identification (20 minutes)

### Task 1.1: Analyze the Three Gulfs

For each gulf, identify specific manifestations in this scenario:

**Gulf of Comprehension (Developer ‚Üî Data)**
```python
# TODO: Complete this analysis
comprehension_gaps = {
    "data_understanding_issues": [
        # What don't developers understand about the email data?
        # Example: "Unclear about seasonal variations in email types"
    ],
    "domain_knowledge_gaps": [
        # What domain expertise is missing?
    ],
    "data_quality_blindspots": [
        # What data quality issues are invisible to developers?
    ]
}
```

**Gulf of Specification (Developer ‚Üî LLM Pipeline)**
```python
# TODO: Complete this analysis
specification_gaps = {
    "prompt_ambiguities": [
        # Where are prompts unclear or incomplete?
    ],
    "output_format_issues": [
        # How do output specifications fail?
    ],
    "behavior_misalignment": [
        # Where does LLM behavior differ from expectations?
    ]
}
```

**Gulf of Generalization (Data ‚Üî LLM Pipeline)**
```python
# TODO: Complete this analysis
generalization_gaps = {
    "training_production_mismatch": [
        # How does production data differ from training/test data?
    ],
    "edge_case_failures": [
        # What edge cases cause system failures?
    ],
    "context_dependency_issues": [
        # How does performance vary across contexts?
    ]
}
```

### Task 1.2: Evidence Collection

For each identified gap, specify what evidence you would collect:

```python
# TODO: Complete this evidence collection plan
evidence_collection_plan = {
    "comprehension_evidence": {
        "data_analysis_needed": [
            # What data analysis would reveal comprehension gaps?
        ],
        "stakeholder_interviews": [
            # Who should be interviewed and what questions asked?
        ],
        "documentation_review": [
            # What documentation should be examined?
        ]
    },
    "specification_evidence": {
        "prompt_analysis": [
            # How would you analyze prompt effectiveness?
        ],
        "output_validation": [
            # How would you validate output specifications?
        ],
        "behavior_testing": [
            # What tests would reveal specification gaps?
        ]
    },
    "generalization_evidence": {
        "data_comparison": [
            # How would you compare training vs production data?
        ],
        "performance_analysis": [
            # What performance analysis would reveal generalization issues?
        ],
        "failure_investigation": [
            # How would you systematically investigate failures?
        ]
    }

    },
    "review_process": {
        # How will progress be reviewed and adjustments made?
    }
}
```

## ü§î Reflection Questions

After completing the exercise, reflect on these questions:

1. **Gulf Interconnection**: How do the three gulfs interact with each other in this scenario? Which gulf seems to be the primary driver of problems?

2. **Bridging Trade-offs**: What trade-offs did you identify between different bridging strategies? How would you balance short-term fixes vs. long-term solutions?

3. **Measurement Challenges**: What challenges do you anticipate in measuring the effectiveness of your bridging strategies?

4. **Organizational Factors**: How might organizational structure and culture affect the implementation of your bridging strategies?

5. **Scalability**: How would your approach change if this system needed to handle 10x more emails or support multiple languages?

## üìù Deliverables

Submit the following:

1. **Completed code templates** with your analysis and strategies
2. **Written reflection** (500-750 words) addressing the reflection questions
3. **Visual diagram** showing the relationships between the three gulfs in your scenario
4. **Implementation timeline** for your top 3 bridging strategies
