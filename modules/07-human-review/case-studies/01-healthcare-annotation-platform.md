## üéØ **Organization Background**

MedTech Regional Health System serves a population of 2.3 million across the Pacific Northwest, operating 12 medical centers with 450+ radiologists, 1,200+ radiology technicians, and processing over 2.8 million medical images annually. The organization faced significant challenges with their legacy annotation systems that were causing bottlenecks in diagnostic workflows and contributing to radiologist burnout.

### **Pre-Implementation Challenges**

The existing annotation system suffered from multiple critical issues that were impacting both operational efficiency and clinical outcomes. Radiologists reported spending 40-60% of their time navigating complex interfaces rather than focusing on diagnostic analysis. The legacy system's poor usability contributed to a 23% annual turnover rate among radiologists, with exit interviews consistently citing interface frustration as a primary factor.

Annotation inconsistency was a major concern, with inter-radiologist agreement rates averaging only 72% for complex cases. The cumbersome interface made it difficult for radiologists to access relevant patient history, compare with previous studies, and collaborate effectively with colleagues. Error rates were elevated at 8.3% for initial diagnoses, requiring costly re-reviews and contributing to delayed patient care.

The system's poor accessibility meant that radiologists with visual impairments or motor limitations faced significant barriers to effective work. Color-only coding systems, small interface elements, and lack of keyboard navigation options created an exclusive rather than inclusive work environment.

### **Strategic Objectives**

MedTech's leadership established clear objectives for the annotation platform redesign, focusing on measurable improvements in efficiency, accuracy, and user experience. The primary goal was to reduce annotation time by at least 50% while maintaining or improving diagnostic accuracy. Secondary objectives included improving radiologist satisfaction, reducing training time for new staff, and creating a more inclusive work environment.

The organization also sought to position itself as a leader in healthcare AI implementation, using the annotation platform as a foundation for future AI-assisted diagnostic capabilities. Integration with existing hospital information systems and compliance with healthcare regulations were essential requirements.

## üé® **Interface Design Strategy**

The interface design strategy was built on comprehensive user research and human-centered design principles specifically adapted for healthcare environments. The design team conducted over 200 hours of observational studies, interviewed 85 radiologists across different specialties, and analyzed thousands of annotation workflows to understand the cognitive demands and workflow patterns unique to medical imaging.

### **Human-Centered Design Approach**

The design process began with extensive ethnographic research to understand how radiologists actually work, not how administrators assumed they worked. Researchers spent weeks in radiology departments, observing workflow patterns, communication methods, and the cognitive processes involved in image interpretation and annotation.

Key insights emerged from this research that fundamentally shaped the interface design. Radiologists operate in a highly interruption-driven environment, frequently switching between cases, consulting with colleagues, and responding to urgent requests. The interface needed to support rapid context switching while maintaining annotation accuracy and completeness.

Cognitive load analysis revealed that radiologists were spending significant mental energy on interface navigation rather than diagnostic reasoning. The existing system required 12-15 clicks to complete a typical annotation workflow, with critical information scattered across multiple screens. The new design consolidated essential information into a single, intelligently organized workspace.

Visual attention patterns showed that radiologists follow predictable scanning behaviors when reviewing images, typically starting with overall image assessment before focusing on specific regions of interest. The interface was designed to support these natural visual workflows, with annotation tools and information positioned to align with typical attention patterns.

### **Cognitive Load Optimization**

Cognitive load reduction became a central design principle, with every interface element evaluated for its contribution to or detraction from diagnostic reasoning. The design team applied cognitive science principles to minimize extraneous cognitive load while supporting intrinsic and germane cognitive processing related to diagnostic tasks.

Working memory limitations were addressed through persistent display of relevant information, eliminating the need for radiologists to remember details while navigating between screens. Patient history, previous studies, and relevant clinical information remained visible throughout the annotation process, reducing memory burden and supporting more accurate diagnoses.

Information hierarchy was carefully designed to present the most critical information prominently while keeping supporting details accessible but not distracting. Primary diagnostic information occupied the central visual area, with annotation tools positioned for easy access without obscuring image content.

Decision support features were integrated seamlessly into the workflow, providing relevant reference information and diagnostic aids without interrupting the natural flow of image interpretation. AI-powered suggestions were presented as supportive information rather than directive recommendations, maintaining physician autonomy while providing valuable assistance.

### **Accessibility and Inclusive Design**

Universal design principles ensured that the annotation platform could be used effectively by radiologists with diverse abilities and working preferences. The design team worked closely with radiologists who had visual impairments, motor limitations, and other accessibility needs to create truly inclusive interfaces.

Visual accessibility features included high contrast color schemes, scalable text and interface elements, and multiple ways to convey important information beyond color alone. The interface supported screen readers and other assistive technologies through semantic HTML structure and appropriate ARIA labels.

Motor accessibility considerations included large touch targets, keyboard navigation for all functions, and customizable interface layouts that could accommodate different physical capabilities and preferences. Voice control integration enabled hands-free operation for radiologists with motor limitations or those who preferred voice interaction.

Cognitive accessibility features supported radiologists with different learning styles and cognitive preferences through multiple information presentation modes, customizable interface complexity levels, and comprehensive help systems that provided context-sensitive guidance.
