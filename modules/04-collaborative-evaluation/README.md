![Collaborative Evaluation Workflow](../../assets/diagrams/collaborative-evaluation-workflow.png)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 4, where we transition from automated systems to human-centered evaluation practices. This module explores the critical role of human expertise in AI evaluation, providing comprehensive frameworks for building effective collaborative evaluation systems that combine the best of human judgment with systematic processes.

Collaborative evaluation represents one of the most challenging yet essential aspects of AI system development. While automated evaluation provides scale and consistency, human evaluation brings nuanced understanding, contextual awareness, and the ability to assess subjective qualities that automated systems struggle to capture. The key lies in designing collaborative processes that harness human expertise efficiently while maintaining quality and consistency across teams.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- **Design Human-in-the-Loop Systems**: Build comprehensive evaluation workflows that effectively integrate human expertise with automated processes
- **Implement Annotation Interfaces**: Create user-friendly annotation tools that maximize annotator productivity and data quality
- **Establish Quality Control Processes**: Develop robust quality assurance frameworks that ensure consistent, high-quality evaluation results
- **Measure Inter-Annotator Agreement**: Apply statistical methods to assess and improve consistency across human evaluators
- **Build Team Coordination Systems**: Design collaborative workflows that scale human evaluation across distributed teams
- **Create Knowledge Sharing Frameworks**: Establish systems for capturing, organizing, and disseminating evaluation expertise across organizations
