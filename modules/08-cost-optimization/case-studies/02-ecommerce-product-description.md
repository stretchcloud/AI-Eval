# Case Study 1: E-commerce Product Description Generation

## üìä Executive Summary

**Company**: StyleHub - Mid-size fashion e-commerce platform  
**Challenge**: Inconsistent product descriptions affecting conversion rates and customer experience  
**Solution**: Systematic evaluation approach using Three Gulfs Model and AMI Lifecycle  
**Timeline**: 6 months from initial assessment to full deployment  
**Investment**: $150K in development and evaluation infrastructure  
**Results**: 40% improvement in description quality, 15% increase in conversion rates, 25% reduction in customer service inquiries

## üè¢ Background and Context

### Company Profile
StyleHub is a mid-size fashion e-commerce platform with:
- 500,000+ products across 200+ brands
- 2 million monthly active users
- $50M annual revenue
- 50-person engineering team
- Rapid growth requiring scalable content solutions

### Business Challenge
StyleHub faced significant challenges with product descriptions:
- **Inconsistent quality**: Descriptions varied wildly between brands and categories
- **Missing information**: Key details like sizing, materials, and care instructions often omitted
- **Poor conversion**: Product pages with poor descriptions had 30% lower conversion rates
- **Customer complaints**: 40% of customer service inquiries related to product information gaps
- **Scaling bottleneck**: Manual description writing couldn't keep pace with catalog growth

### Initial System
StyleHub initially used a basic LLM system to generate product descriptions:
- Simple prompt template with product attributes
- No systematic evaluation or quality control
- Ad-hoc improvements based on customer complaints
- No measurement of description quality or business impact

## üîç Challenge Analysis

### Problem Deep Dive
The evaluation team conducted a systematic analysis revealing:

**Quality Issues**:
- 35% of descriptions missing critical information (size, material, care)
- 20% contained factual errors or inconsistencies
- 15% were too generic to be useful for purchase decisions
- Tone and style varied dramatically across product categories

**Business Impact**:
- Products with poor descriptions had 30% lower conversion rates
- Customer service burden increased with catalog growth
- Brand partners complained about misrepresentation
- SEO performance suffered due to thin content

### Three Gulfs Analysis

**Gulf of Comprehension (Team ‚Üî Product Data)**
- **Data Understanding Gaps**: Engineering team lacked deep understanding of fashion domain
- **Attribute Complexity**: Product attributes were inconsistent and often incomplete
- **Quality Blindspots**: Team couldn't distinguish between good and poor descriptions
- **Domain Knowledge**: Limited understanding of what customers needed to make purchase decisions

**Gulf of Specification (Team ‚Üî LLM System)**
- **Prompt Ambiguity**: Prompts were too generic and didn't specify quality requirements
- **Output Format Issues**: No clear specification for description structure and content
- **Behavior Inconsistency**: LLM behavior varied unpredictably across product types
- **Quality Standards**: No clear definition of what constituted a "good" description

**Gulf of Generalization (Data ‚Üî LLM Performance)**
- **Training-Production Mismatch**: Training examples didn't represent full product diversity
- **Category Variations**: Performance varied significantly across fashion categories
- **Seasonal Factors**: Description quality degraded for seasonal or trending items
- **Brand Differences**: System struggled with brand-specific terminology and positioning
