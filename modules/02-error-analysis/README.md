![Error Classification Framework](../../assets/diagrams/error-classification-framework.png)

## Overview

Systematic error analysis represents the cornerstone of building reliable AI systems. While Module 1 introduced the fundamental concepts of AI evaluation, this module dives deep into the methodologies, frameworks, and practical techniques for identifying, categorizing, and addressing errors in AI systems at scale.

The transition from ad-hoc debugging to systematic error analysis marks a critical evolution in AI system development. Organizations that master these techniques build more reliable systems, reduce operational costs, and deliver superior user experiences. This module provides the comprehensive framework and practical tools needed to implement world-class error analysis processes.
