# Marketing Insights Analysis: AI Evals as the Essential 2025 Skill

## Core Value Proposition Analysis

The YouTube video featuring Hamel Husain and Shreya Shankar positions AI Evals as "THE ONE AI Skill Every Product Manager NEEDS in 2025." This creates a powerful foundation for our marketing campaign around the AI Evals Comprehensive Tutorial GitHub project. The positioning leverages several psychological and business drivers that we can amplify in our 60-day campaign.

### Authority and Credibility Leverage

Hamel Husain and Shreya Shankar represent significant authority in the AI evaluation space. Hamel is known for his work at GitHub and his contributions to AI tooling, while Shreya has established herself as a thought leader in ML operations and evaluation. Their endorsement of AI Evals as essential creates a credibility halo that we can leverage for our GitHub project.

The fact that they're described as "creators of the world's best AI Evals cohort" provides social proof that AI evaluation education is in high demand and that there's a recognized need for comprehensive training materials. This validates the value proposition of our comprehensive tutorial.

### Urgency and Timing Positioning

The "2025" framing creates temporal urgency - suggesting that Product Managers who don't develop AI evaluation skills will be left behind. This urgency can be leveraged across our marketing campaign to drive immediate action (GitHub stars, engagement, sharing).

The positioning also suggests that AI Evals is not just a nice-to-have skill but a fundamental requirement for professional relevance in the coming year. This creates FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) that can drive engagement with our educational content.

### Target Audience Insights

The primary target audience is Product Managers, but the broader appeal extends to:
- AI/ML Engineers seeking evaluation best practices
- Data Scientists implementing evaluation frameworks  
- Engineering Leaders building AI-powered products
- Startup Founders integrating AI into their products
- Consultants advising on AI implementation

This diverse audience provides multiple angles for our marketing campaign, allowing us to tailor messages for different professional contexts while maintaining the core value proposition.

## Key Marketing Themes to Develop
