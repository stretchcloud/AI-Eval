# 60-Day Marketing Strategy: AI Evals Comprehensive Tutorial GitHub Project

## Strategic Overview and Campaign Architecture

The 60-day marketing campaign for the AI Evals Comprehensive Tutorial GitHub project is designed to maximize repository stars through a systematic approach that builds awareness, establishes authority, and drives engagement across LinkedIn and X (Twitter). The campaign leverages the urgency and authority established in Hamel Husain and Shreya Shankar's discussion of AI Evals as "THE ONE AI Skill Every Product Manager NEEDS in 2025" to position our comprehensive tutorial as the essential resource for mastering this critical capability.

The campaign architecture follows a three-phase approach that mirrors the customer journey from awareness to action. Phase One (Days 1-20) focuses on building awareness and establishing credibility through educational content and expert positioning. Phase Two (Days 21-40) emphasizes practical value and community building through detailed implementation guidance and case studies. Phase Three (Days 41-60) drives conversion through urgency, social proof, and direct calls-to-action that encourage GitHub stars and community participation.

Each phase incorporates platform-specific strategies that leverage the unique characteristics of LinkedIn and X. LinkedIn content emphasizes professional development, career advancement, and business impact, while X content focuses on quick insights, community engagement, and trending topic participation. The campaign maintains consistent messaging across platforms while adapting format and tone to maximize platform-specific engagement.

The strategic foundation rests on four core pillars that differentiate our tutorial from competing resources. Authority positioning leverages the expertise of recognized AI evaluation leaders and positions our tutorial as aligned with industry best practices.
